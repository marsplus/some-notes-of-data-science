    There are several ways to process categorical features:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ordinal encoding: if the feature can be ranked, e.g., a feature with value $2$ is ranked higher than a feature with value $1$.
            \item One-hot encoding: this does not assume any particular ranking on the feature.
        \end{itemize}
