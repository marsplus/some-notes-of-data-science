This section is based on the materials in Section 10.4 of \cite{trench2013elementary}.
Consider the following ODE with constant coefficient matrix $\bm{A} \in \R^{n \times n}$:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:ode}
        \dot{\bm{x}} = \bm{A} \bm{x}.
    \end{equation}
The following theorem characterizes the solutions of the above system; see Theorem 10.4.1 of \cite{trench2013elementary}.
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $\bm{A}$ has $n$ real eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ (which need not be distinct) with associated linearly independent eigenvectors $\bm{x}_1, \ldots, \bm{x}_n$.
    Then the functions
        \begin{equation}
            \bm{y}_1 = \bm{x}_1 e^{\lambda_1 t}, \ldots, \bm{y}_n = \bm{x}_n e^{\lambda_n t},
        \end{equation}
    form a fundamental set of solutions of \eqref{eq:ode}.
    As a result, any solution $\bm{y}$ of the ODE can be represented by a linear combination of the fundamental solutions, i.e., 
        \begin{equation}
            \bm{y} = c_1 \bm{x}_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} + , \ldots, + c_n \bm{x}_n e^{\lambda_n t}.
        \end{equation}
    The values of the coefficients are determined by initial value conditions.
    
\end{theorem}
